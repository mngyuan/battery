battery
===
Get colored visual battery level output in your shell. 
This is a quick and dirty bash script, and currently only supports Ubuntu/Debian and tmux status-line style output.

Installation
---
Put [battery](battery) and [spark](https://github.com/holman/spark) somewhere in your path.


Notes
---
Inspired by (essentially an Ubuntu port of) [this script for OS X only](https://github.com/Goles/Battery).
